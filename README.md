Get Bonus is a project about discovering the best way to program video
games.

For more information, refer to the
[Wiki](https://github.com/get-bonus/get-bonus/wiki)

Currently, we only support Linux, because of the way I deal with
controllers and sound. If you'd like to patch in support on other
platforms, email me.

If you have Linux, then you run it by...

raco link -r .
racket -t gb/main.rkt

from the Get Bonus repository clone.
