* apse - Animated Paletted Sprite Editor

This is a raster graphics editor designed for precise designs for the
Get Bonus Infinite Entertainment System. It uses a graphics system
designed like the Nintendo Entertainment System.

* Data Concepts

A sprite is a sequence of NxM images, an NxM height map, and a set of
palettes references.

An image is a NxM matrix of values from [0,9]. 0 always designates
total transparency. 1 always designates total blackness. [2,9]
designate a color from a 8-color palette.

A height map is a NxM matrix of values from 0-8, representing the
height of the image.

A palette reference names a palette.

A palette is a sequence of 8 32-bit colors from RGBA color space.

* Questions

Q: Is 8 too small of a color palette?

A: My gut says no because the NES has basically 12 per sprite and the
SNES had 16 per sprite. But I assume (without much evidence) that most
of those were used for shading (like a light version and a dark
version), so it was really 8 in the SNES. Given that I'll have more
powerful and dynamic shading, I don't think this is a big deal.

Q: Would it be a good idea to have a concept of a "mega palette" which
has all the colors a given game would use? For example, all the brick
areas in a platformer might use 14 different colors, but each only 8
at a time. It would be nice to come up with a new 14 color
mega-palette and automatically get all the variations of the bricks.

A: This is a good idea, but I'm not sure the best way to do it. One
idea is to have "linked palettes" where a palette specification can
refer to another one. That is:

A palette is a vector of palette colors. A palette color is either a
32-bit color or a reference to another palette and its color. Palettes
with at least 8 colors are valid for an image.

This would allow a consistent specification of all the palettes for a
given game, but it would not be helpful for creating a new
"mega-palette" and getting all the sprites that use the old one
duplicated. One idea to do that is to have a unit-like system where
sprites/palettes would have input/output signatures. That is:

mega-man-sprite@ requires mega-man-pal^
blue-mm-palette@ provides mega-man-pal^
red-mm-palette@ provides mega-man-pal^

brick-sprite@ requires brick-pal^
default-brick-pal@ requires mario-pal^ and provides brick-pal^
stair-sprite@ requires stair-pal^
default-stair-pal@ requires mario-pal^ and provides stair-pal^
mario-pal@ provides mario-pal^

Using these specifications, apse could display all the different
palettes valid for the sprite. (Essentially by solving a Prolog query
to synthesize the palettes.) Editing and creating such palettes would
be complicated though.

* Data Layout

apse does not work on individual files. Instead, it opens a database
laid out as follows:

* root                  # name of database
\ last.rktd             # edit state
\ sprites
  \ <a>
    \ <b>
      \ <c>.spr         # data for sprite "a/b/c"
       | meta           # width and height information
       | 0.img
       | ...            # image sequence
       | n.img         
       | height.map     # height map (optionally auto-generated)
       | normal.map     # normal map (auto-generated)
       | palettes       # list of palette strings
\ palettes
  \ <a>
    \ <b>
      | <c>.pal         # data for palette "a/b/c"

We assume the database is (or is part of) a git repository.

* Data Notes

A height map can be automatically generated by overlaying all the
non-0 pixels from the image sequence of a sprite, then applying a
gradient from the inside to the outside. apse does this automatically
when you change any image. You can modify the normal map manually, at
which point apse won't automatically update it, but will just warn you
that it is out-of-date.

A height map is converted into a normal map for lighting effects. This
is done automatically when an out-of-date normal map (relative to the
height map) is detected.

* Interface

The interface is primarily keyboard driven using an Emacs/Vim style
system. It looks like this:

| <Image Index> of <Image Max>    | <Sprite Name>                    |

   CLOSED: [2013-05-12 Sun 11:42]
   - encode 4 pixels into one 32-bit pixel
   NxM sprite = NxMx1 bytes but we need it to be divisible by 4.

   (2^n)x(2^m) = 2^(n+m) if n & m > 0, then this is divisible by 4:
   2^(a+b+2) / 4 = 2^(a+b)

   - encode n palettes as nx16 32-bit png
     
     we need 16 because there are really 10 colors and it would be a
     pain in the gpu to do an if for 0 and 1, but I could try that.

** TODO connect to engine
   images were written in ARGB order at w/2 x h/2   
** TODO Make apse purely functional and have better undo system 
   (where it goes back to earlier system states)
** DONE Add animation
** TODO Add height/normal maps & lighting
