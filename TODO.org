  A lot of people online seem to suggest it is bad to use the Z buffer
  because of transparency issues. Strange.
  
  Now use it
* TODO Switch to RacketGL throughout
* TODO Maybe change graphics to fixed pixels?
  Render to a buffer and then display the buffer?
  ---
  Take the SNES w x h and make it wider, see exp/wide.rkt
  ---
  Maybe use bsnes's snesshaders to do the scaling?

  Hopefully this will make planning and text better

  I'm using exp/buffer.rkt to experiment and it is MESSED up.
* TODO Make it so gl:Color doesn't have an alpha arg
  Because by using Z buffer for layers, translucent pixels don't work
  across layers... so maybe it is better to just disallow it?
* TODO Make a faster FPS counter
  Making a texture is slow. Maybe with character-based string textures
  it would be faster?

  Maybe just log data and look at it afterward?

  I don't know if I really am measuring this correctly... see OpenGL wiki
* TODO Read this thing about opengl optimization
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1556535/using-opengl-to-accelerate-2d-graphics?rq=1
* TODO OS suppress updates
  Make a critical region system call that gives a process sole access
  to the system... leaving the other processes stalled with their last
  writes persisting from frame to frame

  This might be a good way to implement "friction" or "bullet time" as
  well as other effects, like menus.

  Just an idea. Might be a bad idea?
* TODO Change controller model
  SNES style
  D-pad is booleans
  Have another right interpretation of dpad

  Get a USB snes controller for home
* TODO Make maze harder over time: faster, more ghosts, squares = score multiplier
* TODO tennis - shake the screen on bounce, gas pedal on paddle for speed, decreasing increasing rate of ball speed growth, add blocks like arkanoid?
* TODO Change gl model to be memoized
* TODO Make games return score information to dashboard for it to manager
  (Version, Level, Numeric Score) from game
  
  (Game, Date, Version, Level, Numeric Score) from dashboard

  Store (cached) locally and online

  Store a cached global ranking
* TODO Make games return replays (and allow them to accept replays)
  Replay = (random seed, level, controller stream)
* TODO Build music libraries based on emotion (fast, race, scary, triump, etc)
* TODO Add "compare with ..." to game info
* TODO Make Anki-like SRS system in dashboard
* TODO Make icons for dashboards vs text
* TODO Make games in dashboard have capabilities
  1P, 2P Round-robin, 2P VS, 2P Co-op, etc
* TODO Make play modes in dashboard
  Single, King-of-the-Hill (play levels that your score has been
  beaten on), Training (improve your score, SRS style), Round-Robin
  (play all games)

  Have it so you can highlight games to be played that way
* TODO Death scream like Ziggurat (in dashboard?)
  Or other stingers, but worry about being too annoying and not
  instant restarting
* TODO Find a unified common score display
  Should I display all points: this session / this game / all games?
* TODO Return achievements (to dashboard)
* TODO Make the 'Home' button in games bring up a dashboard menu (to quit the game, give a ranking, etc)
* TODO Make audio loading lazy (or other things that are slow on boot)
* TODO Use trippy graphics in tennis & maze
* TODO Tennis - ugly score display
* TODO Tennis - revisit use of paddle bounce 
* TODO Make RPS more JRPG-like
* TODO Convert things to typed racket as I go
* TODO Write a generic Godel-encoding library
* TODO Figure out a way to do localization well
* TODO Make more games
* TODO Make something for Racket/emacs to find out what deps aren't needed
* TODO Experiment with located events (in a 2D mesh) rather than flat events
* TODO Make OS use futures for parallelism
  First experiment, 2012/07/01 failed... got a slower frame rate. I
  think the key is to make it just a future during the time that GL is
  rendering.
* TODO Add challenges/achievements/training to NES/SNES games
  Hook up with an emulator core to drop into a game with save states
  and then monitor its execution for score, etc

  Can you beat this Mega Man stage with one life?

  How fast can you do X in this game?

  Wrap this in a package that switches from game to game like I
  want... it may be perfection
