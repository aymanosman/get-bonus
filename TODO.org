* DONE Rewrite maze with OS model
  CLOSED: [2012-07-08 Sun 00:32]
* TODO Improve maze OS structure
* TODO OS - fix connection to 3s
  There is a use in tennis that would be fixed

  And maze uses it for the background music
* TODO Make a faster FPS counter
  Making a texture is slow. Maybe with character-based string textures
  it would be faster?
* TODO Figure out how to use OpenGL depth bit for background/foreground
* TODO Make maze harder over time: faster, more ghosts, squares = score multiplier
* TODO Change gl model to be memoized
* TODO Make games return score information to dashboard for it to manager
  (Version, Level, Numeric Score) from game
  
  (Game, Date, Version, Level, Numeric Score) from dashboard

  Store (cached) locally and online

  Store a cached global ranking
* TODO Make games return replays (and allow them to accept replays)
  Replay = (random seed, level, controller stream)
* TODO Build music libraries based on emotion (fast, race, scary, triump, etc)
* TODO Add "compare with ..." to game info
* TODO Make Anki-like SRS system in dashboard
* TODO Make icons for dashboards vs text
* TODO Make games in dashboard have capabilities
  1P, 2P Round-robin, 2P VS, 2P Co-op, etc
* TODO Make play modes in dashboard
  Single, King-of-the-Hill (play levels that your score has been
  beaten on), Training (improve your score, SRS style), Round-Robin
  (play all games)

  Have it so you can highlight games to be played that way
* TODO Make the 'Home' button in games bring up a dashboard menu (to quit the game, give a ranking, etc)
* TODO Make audio loading lazy (or other things that are slow on boot)
* TODO Use trippy graphics in tennis & maze
* TODO Tennis - ugly score display
* TODO Tennis - revisit use of paddle bounce 
* TODO Make RPS more JRPG-like
* TODO Convert things to typed racket as I go
* TODO Write a generic Godel-encoding library
* TODO Figure out a way to do localization well
* TODO Make more games
* TODO Make something for Racket/emacs to find out what deps aren't needed
* TODO Make OS use futures for parallelism
  First experiment, 2012/07/01 failed... got a slower frame rate. I
  think the key is to make it just a future during the time that GL is
  rendering.
